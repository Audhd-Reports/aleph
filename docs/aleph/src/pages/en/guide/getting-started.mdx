Part of the Aleph toolkit has been Aleph Data Desktop, a tool to sketch out networks of companies, people and their relationships on your own computer. As of September 2022, Data Desktop has been deprecated and we do not recommend creating new network diagrams in Data Desktop, but we will keep documentation online for existing users and users looking to export their network diagrams from Data Desktop to Aleph.
